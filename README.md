# Text-extraction-from-images
Text-OCR Project made using guidance from tutorial - to extract texts in an image
TextOCR requires models to perform text-recognition on arbitrary shaped scene-text present on natural images. TextOCR provides ~1M high quality word annotations on TextVQA images allowing application of end-to-end reasoning on downstream tasks such as visual question answering or image captioning.
